# Regression Analysis and Results Visualization

Prediction and classification modelling through RStudio

This project focuses on performing regression analysis and visualizing the results using RStudio. Regression analysis is a statistical technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It helps in understanding and predicting the impact of independent variables on the dependent variable.

The purpose of this project is to showcase the application of regression analysis in a practical context and demonstrate how to interpret and visualize the results using RStudio. By using various regression techniques, we aim to uncover relationships, make predictions, and gain insights into the data.
Project Features

    Perform data preprocessing: Cleaning, handling missing values, and transforming variables if necessary.
    Explore and analyze the dataset: Examine the distribution of variables, identify outliers, and assess correlations.
    Build regression models: Utilize different regression techniques such as linear regression, logistic regression, or polynomial regression.
    Assess model performance: Evaluate the accuracy and goodness of fit of the regression models.
    Visualize results: Generate visualizations such as scatter plots, line plots, or bar graphs to interpret and communicate the regression results effectively.

Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:
